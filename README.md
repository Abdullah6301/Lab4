Question No 2:
Purpose:
The Sort Descending method allows users to input a set of numbers, stores them in an Array List, and sorts them in descending order using the Collections.sort() method.
Arguments:
No arguments are passed explicitly to the method. It uses the Scanner instance sc created externally to take user input.
Return:
No explicit return value as the method sorts and displays the sorted array in descending order directly in the console.
Instructions:
•	The method prompts the user to enter the count of numbers to be sorted.
•	It then prompts for each number in sequence.
•	After inputting all numbers, it sorts them in descending order using the Collections.sort() method with Collections.reverseOrder().
•	Finally, it displays the sorted array in descending order in the console.

Question no 4:
Arguments:
int[][] matrixA: The first matrix to be multiplied.
int[][] matrixB: The second matrix to be multiplied.
Return:
int[][]: Returns the resulting matrix after matrix multiplication.
Instructions:
•	The method takes two 2D integer arrays (matrixA and matrixB) as arguments.
•	It calculates the dimensions of the resulting matrix based on the dimensions of the input matrices.
•	It performs matrix multiplication using nested loops, applying standard matrix multiplication algorithms.
•	The resulting matrix is displayed in the console.
•	Finally, it returns the resulting matrix obtained after matrix multiplication.



Question No 6:
Purpose:
The matrixMultiplication method performs matrix multiplication for two given matrices (matrixA and matrixB). It calculates the resulting matrix by applying standard matrix multiplication rules and displays the resulting matrix in the console.
Arguments:
int[][] matrixA: The first matrix to be multiplied.
int[][] matrixB: The second matrix to be multiplied.
Return:
int[][]: Returns the resulting matrix after matrix multiplication.
Instructions:
•	The method takes two 2D integer arrays (matrixA and matrixB) as arguments.
•	It calculates the dimensions of the resulting matrix based on the dimensions of the input matrices.
•	It performs matrix multiplication using nested loops, applying standard matrix multiplication algorithms.
•	The resulting matrix is displayed in the console.
•	Finally, it returns the resulting matrix obtained after matrix multiplication.
